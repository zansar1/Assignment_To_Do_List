# Assignment_To_Do_List
This is a python app that allows students to input their assignment names and due dates and displays them.

Purpose: The purpose of this app is to allow users to keep track of their assignments and their due dates. Users can add new assignments to the list, and display the list of assignments at any time. The app uses a simple command-line interface and a list data structure to store the assignments.

The app prompts the user to enter their choice (1-3) from the menu. Option 1 allows the user to add a new assignment to the list by entering the assignment name and due date. Option 2 displays the list of assignments, and if there are no assignments in the list, it displays a message informing the user that there are no assignments. Option 3 allows the user to exit the program.

This app can be further improved by adding features such as the ability to delete assignments, sort assignments by due date, and set reminders for upcoming assignments. Additionally, a graphical user interface (GUI) can be used to make the app more user-friendly and visually appealing.
